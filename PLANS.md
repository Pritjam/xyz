## Plans

 - Website with a command-line interface, a la "buy captain forever trilogy"  
 - Written in... react? angular? probably gotta learn more about webdev first...  
 - Black and green style (optional accessibility options?)  
 - Gotta involve my favorite color, <span style="color:#2dedb7">Seafoam Green</span>  
 - Includes: resume, astrophotography, ham radio, software projects, and other DIY projs

### Command-Line Interface

 - Linux style cmdline interface
 - Supports `ls` to view files in current dir
 - Invoking a filename opens that webpage? or maybe just prints out text? (let's go with opens the webpage)
 - Really want this to actually reflect structure of the website itself (probably won't work with JS-based thing tho, i doubt that's how JS pages work. Oh well.)
 - Other commands:
   - `cd` to change dirs
   - `cat` to read out contents of a file (won't literally read it out, just maybe a description?)
   - `startx` which will navigate to a more user-friendly form of the webpage
   - `help` will list available commands
   - `man` will bring up a manual
   - `pwd` print working directory
   - `exit` closes the page
   - `htop` ? might be a little more advanced, but could be cool
   - `ping` could be cool.
   - `echo` ... it's echo.

https://terminal.jcubic.pl/ is one option.
https://github.com/asrvd/AshTerm/tree/main is an interesting iteration of this.
